# IPA_Transcription

## This project uses the modern Lyric Diction framework to transcribe English words to their accepted IPA symbols

## Sources: English Diction Lyric Workbook, Cheri Montgomery

## Important note: Lyric diction(ie for singing) has subtle distinctions from normal English diction used in language. 

## Future Steps: Currently working on a web version to be run without an IDE installed; also a version with more languages available. 

### Prerequisites: Must have JDK and IDE to run

### Steps: Download the source file and data files to run in your own IDE. Type in the ENGLISH words you want transcribed.
